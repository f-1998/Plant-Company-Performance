# Plant Company Performance

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes business performance using key metrics such as sales, quantity, gross profit, and account profitability. The report features dynamic visualizations and switch measures, providing actionable insights into current and prior year performance.

## Key Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- Imported data from Excel, including fact, account, and product hierarchy tables.
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates, renaming tables, and creating calculated columns.
- Built a date table for advanced time-based analysis.

### 2. Measure Creation and Switch Measures
- Created base measures for sales, quantity, COGS, and GP%.
- Developed YTD and PYTD measures for performance comparison.
- Implemented switch measures with slicers for dynamic metric selection.

### 3. Visual Customization
- Applied a custom background and consistent visual formatting.
- Designed card visuals, slicers, tree maps, scatter charts, and waterfall charts.
- Applied conditional formatting to emphasize key metrics.

### 4. Advanced Visualizations
- Utilized tree maps for YTD vs PYTD sales comparison by country.
- Created scatter charts for account profitability analysis, with benchmarks for GP% and YTD sales.

## Structured Table Overview
- **Fact Table**: Transactional data, including sales, quantity, and GP%.
- **Account Table**: Account-specific details such as regions and customer IDs.
- **Product Hierarchy Table**: Hierarchical classification of products for drilldown analysis.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Sales**: Revenue generated during the period.
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold.
- **COGS**: Cost of goods sold.
- **Gross Profit Percentage (GP%)**: Profitability metric calculated from sales and COGS.
- **YTD vs PYTD**: Year-over-year comparison of performance metrics.

## Key Takeaways
- Dynamic switch measures enhance report interactivity.
- Custom visual formatting improves readability and user engagement.
- Advanced scatter charts and tree maps offer insight into underperforming countries and accounts.

## Conclusion

The Project effectively demonstrates the power of dynamic data visualization and advanced analytics in uncovering key business insights. By integrating measures like sales, quantity, cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross profit percentage (GP%), the report provides a comprehensive overview of business performance. The use of year-to-date (YTD) and prior year-to-date (PYTD) comparisons allows for insightful period-over-period analysis, enabling better decision-making.

The advanced visualizations, such as scatter charts for profitability analysis and tree maps for performance by country, help identify trends, pinpoint underperforming regions, and prioritize high-value accounts. Through the implementation of switch measures, the report enables users to dynamically toggle between key metrics, enhancing interactivity and user engagement.
